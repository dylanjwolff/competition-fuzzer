## You can re-implement the coverage class to change how
## the fuzzer tracks new behavior in the SUT

# class MyCoverage(cv.Coverage):
#
#     def coverage(self):
#         <your implementation here>
#
#     etc...


## You can re-implement the runner class to change how
## the fuzzer tracks new behavior in the SUT

# class MyRunner(mf.FunctionRunner):
#
#     def run_function(self, inp):
#           <your implementation here>
#
#     def coverage(self):
#           <your implementation here>
#
#     etc...


## You can re-implement the fuzzer class to change your
## fuzzer's overall structure

# class MyFuzzer(gbf.GreyboxFuzzer):
#
#     def reset(self):
#           <your implementation here>
#
#     def run(self, runner: gbf.FunctionCoverageRunner):
#           <your implementation here>
#   etc...

## The Mutator and Schedule classes can also be extended or
## replaced by you to create your own fuzzer!


    
# When executed, this program should run your fuzzer for a very 
# large number of iterations. The benchmarking framework will cut 
# off the run after a maximum amount of time
#
# The `get_initial_corpus` and `entrypoint` functions will be provided
# by the benchmarking framework in a file called `bug.py` for each 
# benchmarking run. The framework will track whether or not the bug was
# found by your fuzzer -- no need to keep track of crashing inputs
